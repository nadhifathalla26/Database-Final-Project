# Database-Final-Project
This repository is for Database final project. In this project, we are going to make a Database System In Magazine Production. This project is developed using python programming language and we are using many function that we created, such as function to connect the program and the database, function to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data from database, function to make some interactive CLI interface, and function to start the program. After the program has been finished developed and we evaluate it, this project can work nicely according to the project purposes
